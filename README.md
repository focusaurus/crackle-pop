# Crackle Pop

This is a small programming exercise coded in rust as part of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) application by Peter Lyons in June 2017.

## Instructions

Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.

## Rust Ability Caveat

At the time of writing, I was very much a beginner in the rust programming language.

## How to...

- run tests: `cargo test`
- run: `cargo run`
- build for production: `cargo build --release`
